# D3-based multi-line chart demo

Anyone can learn to code!

Here we'll show:
- fetch data
- process data
- visualize data

All with a single JS file, hosted anywhere, browser debuggable, etc.


Graphing from: https://observablehq.com/@d3/multi-line-chart
  - wasn't ever published to `npm`

Demo live at: https://traceypooh.github.io/multi-line-chart/
(can take awhile to load data from https://archive.org ...)


## Key Ppoints
- can load page entirely locally
  - `open index.html` in safari :)

- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
  - `import` JS directly (without `npm` or `node_modules`)
  - https://esm.archive.org
    - no tracking
    - JS, CSS, imagery
