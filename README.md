# How a Denosaur ðŸ¦• is making it so Everyone Can Code

[Aaron Swartz Day 2021](https://www.aaronswartzday.org/asd-2021/)
coding talk.

## Abstract
Aaron Swartz wanted to democratize everything - and put power in the hands of everyone instead of the hands of the few with the most power.  Coding has become a critical skill these days.  Traditionally, there's a lot of setup to even create a basic "hello world" website, in any language.

With the advent of Static Site Generators, popular for blogs, and free hosting on github or gitlab pages, how can we leverage that pattern with modern JavaScript?

Tracey will show and live code a single JS file that does a fun graph visualization of archive.org live concerts, and how anyone can code like this with zero setup or requirements.

## Anyone can learn to code!

Here we'll show:
- fetch data
- process data
- visualize data

All with a single JS file, hosted anywhere, browser debuggable, etc.


JS graph code from: https://observablehq.com/@d3/multi-line-chart
  - (it wasn't ever published to `npm`)

## Demo
this code is live at: https://traceypooh.github.io/multi-line-chart/

(can take awhile to load data from https://archive.org ...)


## Key Points

- can load page entirely locally
  - `open index.html` in _safari_ :)
    - [Preferences] [Advanced] Show Develop menu in menu bar âœ…
    - During dev:
      - [Develop] Disable Local File Restrictions âœ…

- Content Delivery Network (CDN)
  - `import` JS directly (without `npm`, `node` or `node_modules`)
  - https://www.skypack.dev/
  - https://esm.sh/

  - https://esm.ext.archive.org
    - no tracking
    - JS, CSS, imagery


## Back-end JS ðŸ¦•

- https://deno.land
- made by creator of `node`
- most browser code works in backend
- web standards like `fetch()` and `URL`
- can `import` from any url
  - GitHub / GitLab
  - personal webserver
  - CDNs like Skypack, esm.sh
